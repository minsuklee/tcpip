tcpip
=====
This is a clean-room TCP/IP implementation for MS-DOS, Windows 3.x or
Microsoft operating systems earlier than Windows 95.

It can be built with Borland C 3.0, and MS Macro Assembler.
hmm, It's quite old, 
so don't expect clean compilation with contemporary tools.

This source is BSD licensed.
I wrote whole code from scratch.
(Yes, some of headers were C&P'ed from ..., you know.)

IMIGE Systems Inc., an ancient company I worked for
does not exist on earth any more.

Let me know any issues on the source.
